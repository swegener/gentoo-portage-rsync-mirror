*ddcutil-0.6.0 (14 Nov 2016)

  14 Nov 2016; David Seifert <soap@gentoo.org> +ddcutil-0.6.0.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  Renamed from ddctool, bump to 0.6.0

  This release strictly dealt with changing the name with no new
  bug fixes or features.

  Reason for rename from upstream:
  As of release 0.6, the name of this program is changing from ddctool
  to ddcutil to avoid confusion with a commerical datacenter program
  also named ddctool.
