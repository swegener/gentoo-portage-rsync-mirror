In order to better reflect the graphics chipsets present on modern
systems, the default VIDEO_CARDS setting has been changed to
"amdgpu fbdev intel nouveau radeon radeonsi vesa"

If your graphics chipset requires a different driver, and you have not set
VIDEO_CARDS in make.conf, it is advisable to do that now.
