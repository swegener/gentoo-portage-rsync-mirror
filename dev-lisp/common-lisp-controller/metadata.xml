The Common Lisp Controller was originally used in the Debian project.  The Common
Lisp Contoller lets you install and manage common lisp sources and compilers.
It creates a user-specific cache of compiled objects.  When a library or an
implementation is upgraded all compiled objects in the cache are flushed.
