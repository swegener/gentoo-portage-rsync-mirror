  PythonQt is a dynamic Python binding for the Qt framework.
  It offers an easy way to embed the Python scripting language
  into your C++ Qt applications.
  The focus of PythonQt is on embedding Python into
  an existing C++ application, not on writing the whole
  application completely in Python.
