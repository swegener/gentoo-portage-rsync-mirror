*fedmsg-0.18.0 (12 Nov 2016)

  12 Nov 2016; Kent Fredric <kentnl@gentoo.org> +fedmsg-0.18.0.ebuild,
  +files/0.18.0-endpoints.patch, +files/0.18.0-no_signatures.patch,
  +metadata.xml:
  Added at version 0.18.0

  Configuration optimised for making anitya
  (https://release-monitoring.org) work out of the box: This includes
  disabling verification by default, as its currently impossible to
  get x509 verification working on Python 3.5

  People who want signature verification enabled are encouraged to
  install for python 2.7, and RDEPEND is configured to automatically
  pull in m2crypto if you opt to build for python 2.7

  However, getting it working will still require m2ext being added to
  tree somewhere, which is dubious given m2ext hasn't been touched
  since 2012

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.2
